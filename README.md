# cli-color - generate tailwind.css color palettes with npx
Generate color palettes in JSON from your CLI, for use with [Tailwind CSS](http://tailwindcss.com) or anything you like. Simply run an npx command

## How to use cli-color

To use this, just run:

```
npx @danieljpalmer/cli-color
```

and follow the steps.

It'll ask you for a primary brand color (i.e. your root color), and then ask if you want grays (with the primary color infused) and utilities (success, error, warning) too.

The palette gets generated instantly and copied to your clipboard for pasting into your Tailwind.config!

## Running it locally

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and run:

```
npm start
```

To achieve the same thing.
