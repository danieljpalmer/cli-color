# cli-color - generate Tailwind color palettes with npx
Generate color palettes in JSON from your CLI, for use with Tailwind CSS or anything you like.

To use this, just run:

```
npx @danieljpalmer/cli-color
```

and follow the steps.

It'll ask you for a primary brand color (i.e. your root color), and then ask if you want grays (with the primary color infused) and utilities (success, error, warning) too.

The palette gets generated instantly and copied to your clipboard for pasting into your Tailwind.config!

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and run:

```
npm start
```

To achieve the same thing.
